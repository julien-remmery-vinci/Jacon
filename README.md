# Jacon
Easy to use Json parsing library in C

# Development
This library is in development and is not ready for use.

# Description
Convert an input string into a queryable object or an object into a string.

# How to use
Add this where you plan to use Jacon and ... use it ?
```C
#define JACON_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "jacon.h"
```

# Tests
Inputs tested using validation files from:
- [JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite)

# Origin of Jacon
- Name :
Json -> Jason, Jason is already used in other langages for parsing Json.
We doing C so replace 's' by 'c' -> Jacon.
As easy as that.

- Why : I want to experience building a json parser, I plan to use it in my C webserver implementation.

- Why tho : Building things from sratch is fun.

# Thanks
- Thanks to - [JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite) for the test files.
